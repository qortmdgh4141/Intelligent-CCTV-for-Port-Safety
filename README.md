# Intelligent_CCTV_Module_for_Port_Safety📷
⚠️ The project is still in progress... --> planned to be completed around November
#### Motivation for development 👋

This study proposes an intelligent CCTV, Smart Eye, to help managers respond quickly and accurately to dangerous situations after real-time detection of accidents and abnormal behaviors that occur in violation of safety rules at ports. 

Smart Eye uses Computer Vision-based various Object Detection and Action Recognition models to determine compliance with safety rules and abnormal behavior, implement Object Tracking, Region of Interest (ROI), and distance measurement algorithms between objects to measure intrusion, roaming, and contact accident risk. 

The automated 24-hour monitoring system can establish an "intelligent infrastructure" that enables efficient management/operation by quickly delivering data collected at each location to managers and grafting it to an integrated control center in the port after real-time video data analysis and judgment processing. 

This system is expected to contribute to the introduction of a smart port system and the creation of a smart city soon.
